December 5, 2014. You’re on your way home from school and the brutal coldness of the early winter is biting you. The sensation of this snaps you back to reality after getting visions about the world ending. You feel your head aching and blood boiling. The walk to your home almost seems like the longest hike you’ve ever taken in your entire life. While on the walk, you start to contemplate what the visions meant and if they would actually happen. Interrupted by a sudden shout of your name in the distance, “Jackson!!!”. You turn around and see your best friend, Amber. Without hesitation, your expression turns into a happy one. Amber has been in your entire life since you were a toddler and no matter how many times you see her, you’re always happy when you do. She sprints up the hill you’re on and asks, “Hey dudee, where were you, you left without me.” You respond, “I thought you had a club to go to.” She mentioned that it was canceled. Both of you walk on the same sidewalk talking about the most random stuff. Once you made it to your house, outside Amber nervously says she has something to tell you. But being the oblivious person you are, you interrupt her saying that you have a headache, and ask if she could tell you tomorrow. Your headache worsens by the door of your bedroom and you collapse on your bed. In your sleep, you just realized what hint she was trying to give, but you turned her down cause your head hurt. You overthink and completely obsessed over the mistake you made. Until, BOOM!!! You jolt from your bed and see a red flare of smoke in the sky from your bedroom window. Sirens blare and outside you can see otherworldly monsters... Your visions came true. A minute after this, you heard a loud voice echo from where the flare came from saying, “Any other survivors out there, there is a safe house at the local South Seattle Forest. I repeat anyone who is still alive out, there is a safe house at the local South Seattle Forest.” The realization that the world is ending came quick. However, you were still hung on the potential confession from Amber. Before the entire world collapses, you wanted to talk to Amber one last time, so you grew the determination to stay alive until that happens.
